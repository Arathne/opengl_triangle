## opengl triangles

### repository dedicated to making triangles in opengl for practice

##### just a simple college student trying to learn opengl. Most of the online sources are quite different from each other which makes it a little difficult to learn. So, I'm trying to keep it as bare bones as possible while trying to keep consistency. This is more for me to use as a reference, but feel free to look around.

##### developed in linux
