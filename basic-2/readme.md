### opengl core profile to draw a triangle (modern opengl)

#### core profile requires a vertex shader, fragment shader, and a vao or else it won't draw anything. Took me a couple hours to figure out...

#### like .cpp files, .shader files are simple ascii files that you can open up in any text editor.
